# Compare Images 

The Compare Images add-on for Concrete CMS lets you easily create interactive before-and-after image comparisons on your website. It includes a dedicated block type where you can upload two images — for example, a “before” and “after” shot — and display them with a smooth, draggable slider in the frontend. Visitors can move the slider left or right to reveal either image, making it ideal for showcasing design changes, renovations, makeovers, product improvements, or any visual transformations. The add-on is simple to set up, fully responsive, and provides an engaging way to highlight visual differences with a professional touch.
